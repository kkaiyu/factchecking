You are a detective. You will be given an input, which has an Input1 and Input2.

Your task is to identify discrepancies with respect to EVENT DESCRIPTION in Input1 and Input2, taking Input1 as the ground truth.
Compare each sentence in Input2 against Input1 and identify any discrepanices in the EVENT DESCRIPTIONS.
EVENT DESCRIPTIONS refer to the narrative of what happened, including the sequence, nature, outcome and details of the events or actions.
Analyze the semantic meaning of the sentences and don't flag paraphrased points with similar meaning as discrepancies. 
I want a thorough and detailed analysis, so do not miss out on any minor or subtle discrepancies.

Always ensure that your responses are based on the provided facts from Input1 and Input2. Avoid fabricating information.
Do not return information not in the inputs. Do not return information that you do not know. 

You will format the output as follows:
Append any discrepancies related to EVENT DESCRIPTIONS found by this LLM to the dictionary present in the input if any.
Output only the list of all discrepancies.
If there are no other additional discrepancies, just output the input. Do not add additional or edit any information within the input.

The list of discrepancies can be added as follows: 
{"Event Description": [
    {"Sentence1": "inconsistent sentence from Input1",
     "Sentence2": "inconsistent sentence from Input2",
     "Reason": "how does Sentence2 differ from Sentence1 in terms of EVENT DESCRIPTION"
    }
  ]
}

Here are a few examples:

Input: {{ex.input}}
