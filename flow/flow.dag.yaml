    default: A woman who was facing bankruptcy cheated her boss at a real estate
      firm into giving her a total of S$3.7 million (US$2.8 million), including
      his life savings and the sales proceeds of two of his properties. The
      69-year-old man later borrowed from his niece to keep handing money to the
      woman, and now stays in a rented home with his wife. Lynn Charlotte James,
      a 47-year-old Singaporean, began working at the unidentified real estate
      firm around 2006. In 2008, she began having financial difficulties and
      faced bankruptcy. She devised a plan to cheat the victim and told the
      victim that she had become bankrupt and lied to him that the Insolvency
      and Public Trustee's Office (IPTO) had retained funds in her bankruptcy
      estate. She asked the victim to help her pay various purported fees to
      IPTO so that IPTO would release the funds to her. The man believed James
      and gave her sums of money. As time passed, James demanded more and more
      cash from him, telling him that she would return him all the money he had
      given her once IPTO released the funds in her bankruptcy estate. The
      victim was convinced that he had to keep transferring money to James, as
      she said she could not return the money he had already given her if IPTO
      did not release her funds, and he wanted to recover the substantial sums.
      James also created fictitious emails from government agencies such as IPTO
      and the Ministry of Law to corroborate her lies. In the forged emails, the
      government agencies purportedly demanded various fees payable to IPTO. She
      also warned him not to report the matter, saying that IPTO would
      confiscate her funds if they found out he was helping her and he would not
      be able to get any money back. For more than nine years between May 2008
      and October 2017, the victim transferred S$3,677,537.03 to James over
      2,253 transactions. He depleted his life savings to give money to James
      and also took money from his wife. He and his wife sold two of their
      properties to raise funds to give to James, and they now stay in a rented
      home.

    default: A woman swindled her boss of more than $3.67 million after saying she
      was a bankrupt and needed his help to pay “fees” to the Insolvency and
      Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO). Lynne Charlotte Wilson cheated her boss in
      2,253 instances from June 2010 to October 2017, and he now lives in a
      rented home with his wife after depleting his life savings  helping her.
      The couple had also sold five of their properties to raise money for her.
      Lynne had used the ill-gotten gains to settle her personal expenses and
      repay loans that she had taken from moneylenders. Around 2008, she worked
      at a financial services firm and was the victim’s subordinate. She was
      facing bankruptcy in 2008 and devised a plan to cheat the victim. She then
      lied to the victim by stating that IPTO had retained funds in her
      bankruptcy estate, and that she required the victim to help her pay
      various fees to IPTO before IPTO would release the funds to her. The man
      believed her and gave her money. She continued asking for more. Lynne
      claimed that once the money was paid, IPTO would release the funds in her
      so-called “bankruptcy estate”, which purportedly included the amount she
      had paid with his contribution. She told him she would repay everything
      she had borrowed from him. But Lynne claimed she would not be able to do
      this if IPTO did not release her money. This convinced the man to continue
      transferring money to Lynne, in the hope that IPTO would release her
      “funds”. To corroborate her lies, Lynne created fictitious Whatsapp
      messages from IPTO and the Ministry of Finance, purportedly demanding from
      her various fees payable to IPTO. She forwarded these forged Whatsapp
      messages to the victim. She told the victim the funds he had contributed
      would be confiscated if she stopped paying the “fees” to IPTO, and that he
      would be unable to recover the cash. The accused warned the victim not to
      report the matter to the police or IPTO, (claiming) that if IPTO found out
      that the victim was helping her with her bankruptcy payments, IPTO would
      confiscate her funds and there would be no return of monies to the victim.
