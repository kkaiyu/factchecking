      Phoon Chiu Yoke, more popularly known as “Badge Lady”, was convicted of
      four charges after a trial, three of which were for not wearing a mask in
      Orchard Road. The first charge was for walking maskless at Mandarin
      Gallery in Orchard Road from 3.02pm to 3.04pm on March 6, 2022. The second
      was for not wearing a mask while walking past a Victoria’s Secret shop
      between 3.35pm and 3.37pm on the same day. Wearing masks outdoors became
      optional in Singapore only from March 29, 2022. Another charge was for
      walking within Ion Orchard mall without a mask on Aug 16, 2022.
      Mask-wearing indoors in places such as malls was made optional only from
      Aug 29, 2022. On Friday, Phoon, 56, had earlier said in her closing
      submissions that there was no longer a requirement to wear a mask now, and
      questioned the need for prosecution. She also cast doubt on the
      closed-circuit television footage of her not wearing a mask that had been
      submitted as evidence, describing it as “staged” footage that did not
      verify her identity. Phoon, who served 12 years in the Republic of
      Singapore Navy as one of its pioneer female naval commanding officers, was
      sentenced to 16 weeks’ jail in September 2021 for a separate set of
      mask-related offences. She first made headlines when she was caught on
      video not wearing a mask at Marina Bay Sand on May 15, 2021. The video
      clip, which went viral, showed her telling safe distancing ambassadors:
      “Who are you? Who are you representing? Where is your badge? Show me your
      badge." Images of her were circulated on social media as she went around
      without a mask at several locations, including Jewel Changi Airport and
      Orchard Road. She will be sentenced on Sept 11. Phoon is liable for
      stiffer punishment as a repeat offender. For each charge she faces, she
      could be fined up to $20,000, or imprisoned up to 12 months, or both,
      which is twice the maximum fine or jail time compared with what a first
      offender might receive.

    default: A woman who shot to notoriety during the COVID-19 pandemic for refusing
      to wear a mask has been convicted again of charges including going
      maskless in Stevens Road. Phoon Chiu Yoke, 43, was convicted of eight
      charges on Friday (Aug 11 2023) for failing to wear a mask and failing to
      attend an investigation by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), after the
      judge found that the prosecution had proven its case. The mask-wearing
      offences took place on Mar 6 and Aug 16 last year. Wearing a mask outdoors
      in Singapore was only made optional on Mar 29 last year. That was extended
      to indoor areas - except on public transport and in healthcare facilities
      - on Aug 29 last year. This is the second time Phoon has been convicted of
      mask-wearing offences. She was sentenced to 10 weeks' jail in September
      2021 for a separate case. In her closing trial submissions, Phoon
      questioned the legality of being prosecuted in the first place. She said
      that the court had spent the last 12 days hearing this matter when it was
      no longer a law to wear a mask in public. She added that the prosecution
      had used footage that was "at such a far distance there was only a blip".
      Phoon shot to notoriety in May 2021 and became known as the "badge lady"
      for demanding to see a safe distancing ambassador's badge after being
      asked to wear a mask. The judge adjourned mitigation and sentencing to
      September. For failing to wear a mask when required, Phoon could be jailed
      for up to a year, fined up to S$20,000 or both as a repeat offender. The
      penalties are the same for a repeat offence of not complying with an
      officer during investigations under the Infectious Diseases Act.
