    type: string
    default: A married woman managed to get three different men to fall in love with
      her and transfer her large sums of money, with one of them cheating his
      parents into handing over their life savings. In total, she cheated 10
      people of more than S$880,000 (US$646,000). Even when she was charged and
      her trial was pending, 49-year-old Joceyln Kwek Sok Koon managed to cheat
      her husband's ex-colleague of S$338,600, lying to him that she could help
      him obtain permanent residency in Singapore. Kwek pleaded guilty on
      Thursday (Oct 12) to multiple charges of cheating. She was remanded and
      listened morosely to the proceedings with a mask over her face, appearing
      haggard. The court heard that Kwek got to know her lover and co-accused
      Lai Sze Yin in July 2016, when the 24-year-old man delivered a parcel to
      her home. Even though Kwek was married and had two children, she began
      dating Lai. To conceal her real identity from Lai's family, she created a
      persona she assumed - a young woman named Rachel Lam Xin Yi who was
      studying in the National University of Singapore. She never met Lai's
      family but would talk to his parents over the phone, gaining their trust
      that way and buying them gifts. She managed to get Lai to trick his
      parents and younger sister into handing over a total of S$150,000 on the
      guise of investments or a car loan. Lai's mother lodged a police report in
      October 2018 saying her son's girlfriend had cheated her entire savings
      and had been uncontactable for over a year. While Kwek had no previous
      convictions, she should not be treated as a first-time offender,
      considering she's a serial cheat who had scammed at least 10 known victims
      of a substantial amount of money. Lai was sentenced to 15 months' jail in
      June 2021 for his role in cheating his family. At the time, he promised
      his parents that he would work extremely hard to return all their life
      savings.

    default: Three men separately thought that they had found the love of their life
      in Jamie Chua. Instead, two later found their bank accounts emptied and
      one was cheated his family of their savings after falling for her. Love
      was not the only tool Kwek used to scam her victims. She sometimes posed
      as the daughter of a family in the freight trading business and cheated
      people who trusted her as their god-daughter. She also cheated her
      husband’s colleague of S$4000 through lies that she had leukaemia, and
      that she could help him handle his Singapore permanent residency
      application. In total, Kwek cheated at least 10 victims of at least
      S$880,448.40, and some of the offences were committed while she was on
      bail awaiting trial for her crimes. On Thursday (Oct 12), Chua, 49,
      pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal breach of trust, and six charges
      of cheating. Sometime in February 2013, Kwek got to know Lai Sze Yin, 28,
      and they entered a romantic relationship although Kwek was married. In
      order to conceal her real identity, Kwek was known to Lai’s family as
      “Rachel Lam”. Lai's family knew that "Rachel" was the same age as him and
      that she studied at the Nanyang Technological University. Kwek never met
      Lai’s parents but would speak to them over the phone and buy them gifts.
      Lai’s parents trusted her so much that his mother asked Kwek to treat her
      “like her mother” and told her that she was “one of her children”. Lying
      about a potential investment among other things, Kwek and Lai cheated his
      parents and younger sister of a total of S$150,454, court documents
      stated. However, Kwek’s charges related to S$89,000 of the total sum.
      Lai’s grandmother made a police report on Oct 30, 2018 after Kwek did not
      return their investment money. After the report was filed, Kwek made
      multiple phone calls to Lai’s parents, hoping that they would drop the
      case. Lai was jailed for one year and three months in 2021 for his
      actions.
