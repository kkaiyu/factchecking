    default: American pop superstar Taylor Swift sent 90,000 fans at London’s
      Wembley Stadium into a frenzy on June 23 during her Eras Tour concert when
      she brought her American football player beau Travis Kelce onstage in a
      surprise appearance. At the singer’s third London show for the Europe leg
      of her world tour, Kelce strutted onstage in a top hat and a tuxedo, and
      joined a skit that doubles as an outfit change before her performance of I
      Can Do It With A Broken Heart. After Swift, 34, pretended to be dead
      following her track The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived and lay on the floor
      of the stage, Kelce, also 34, scooped her up in a bridal-carry and brought
      her to a red couch towards the back of the diamond section of the stage.
      He set her down, fanned her and even dabbed her face with a powder brush
      before he finally began to exit the stage. He also did a couple of cute
      dance moves, which delighted the Swifties in attendance. As she prepared
      to launch into I Can Do It With A Broken Heart, Swift turned around to
      blow Kelce a kiss, before he exited the stage with backup dancers Kam
      Saunders and Jan Ravnik. The skit reflects the lyrics of that track, where
      Swift sings about performing and releasing music while being deeply
      depressed and heartbroken over her break-ups with English actor Joe Alwyn
      and English rocker Matty Healy. His onstage appearance comes hot on the
      heels of the couple going Instagram-official. Swift posted a backstage
      selfie of herself, Kelce, as well as Britain’s Prince William and his
      children – Prince George and Princess Charlotte – on her official
      Instagram account on June 22. The London show marks the first time Kelce
      has appeared on The Eras Tour stage since the power couple reportedly
      started dating in September 2023, although the Kansas City Chiefs player
      has been spotted in the audience many times.

    default: On June 23, at the fourth of eight London Eras Tour shows, Travis Kelce
      graced the famed diamond walkway at Wembley Stadium in his third-ever
      onstage appearance for the Eras Tour. He performed alongside Taylor Swift
      during the intro for "I Can Do It With a Broken Heart" in the newly added
      "Tortured Poets" era of the show. As Swift transitions into the last song
      of the era, she typically acts out a short skit with two of her dancers,
      after she appears to "drop dead" during the penultimate song in the set,
      "The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived". Videos posted to social media showed
      Kelce first carrying Swift to a heart-shaped couch, then brushing her face
      with a makeup brush once she was up again. He showed off some dance moves,
      too, all with a big, goofy smile plastered to his face. Kelce proved to be
      a fearless lover Sunday, joining the trio onstage in full costume, showing
      off his acting chops as if he were auditioning to be a mainstay for the
      rest of the tour. The track, an upbeat pop banger on Swift's latest album,
      appears to be about the Eras Tour itself and how Swift has been able to
      put on one of the biggest and most successful concert runs of all time
      amid a breakup with longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn last year, shortly after
      the tour began. It has already been a big Eras weekend for Kelce, who has
      been to some of the London shows. Swift posted a selfie on Facebook
      featuring Kelce alongside Prince William, Prince George and Princess
      Charlotte, who attended the Friday, June 22 night show. They went public
      with their relationship in September 2023 when Swift attended a Kansas
      City Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears, and they have been caught
      supporting each other and their very public careers ever since.
