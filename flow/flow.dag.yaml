    default: A man, who filmed students near schools and pestered some of them for
      personal details, will return to prison after repeating his earlier
      offences of harassing young girls. In one of the latest incidents, the
      court heard that Fong Poh Kuen had obtained the information of more than
      500 female students in a single day by conducting a fake survey. He also
      secretly filmed girls outside schools by wearing spyglasses – a pair of
      black spectacles that contained pinhole cameras with a video-recording
      function. The 46-year-old was on Wednesday sentenced to 18 months’ jail
      after pleading guilty to a total of 13 charges – three for illegally
      obtaining personal information, one for causing public nuisance and nine
      under the Protection from Harassment Act. On Jan 8, 2020, while
      Anglo-Chinese Junior College was holding an open house for prospective
      students, Fong stood in a public area located between Buona Vista MRT and
      the school. He had blank forms with him, and he would lie to the students
      that he represented an educational institution or government body, and
      deceive them into believing that he was conducting the surveys on their
      authority. He would often film the students with his spyglasses while
      conducting the surveys. Fong then used the data he collected to
      communicate with three of them. Fong had visited some of these schools to
      record video footage of the students, either by placing his phone in his
      breast pocket with the camera facing away from him, or by holding it in
      his hand at chest height. These images were then hidden in a
      password-encrypted mobile application named Vault, which was disguised as
      a calculator app. He had been convicted of similar offences on Oct 1,
      2019, where he was sentenced to three months’ jail and a fine of $8,000.
      His sentence was backdated to Aug 8, 2019. At least 22 police reports were
      filed by different members of the public between June 6, 2020 and Aug 31,
      2022.

    default: While posing as an education surveyor, a man would don a pair of dark
      blue spectacles with hidden cameras to record female students while
      collecting personal information about them. In total, Fong Poh Kuen
      obtained the personal information of more than 200 students. For his
      offences, the 46-year-old was sentenced to 18 months’ jail on Wednesday
      (Aug 30). Fong had previously been convicted in 2019 for harassment, among
      other offences, and sentenced to nine months’ jail. Other than using the
      spy-cam spectacles, Fong would also place his mobile phone in his breast
      pocket facing outward or hold it in his hand at chest height to record the
      students. He would then hide the photos and videos in a password-encrypted
      mobile application disguised as a weather application. The spyglasses were
      bought by Fong after he was released from prison following his 2019
      conviction. To collect the personal information of female students, Fong
      would prepare multiple market research forms and position himself near
      educational institutions before approaching them to fill in the forms,
      focusing on those wearing school uniforms. When asked about the purpose of
      the survey, Fong would tell the students that he represented an
      educational institution or government body to deceive them into believing
      that he was authorised to conduct the surveys. The students would then be
      induced to provide him with their personal information. He would often
      wear the spyglasses with the video-recording function turned on while
      conducting such surveys. Once Fong obtained the personal information, he
      would use it to communicate with the students by repeatedly sending them
      text messages, keeping them under surveillance or both.
