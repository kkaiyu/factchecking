    default: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's
      general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure
      an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he
      will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a
      coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade
      ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing
      ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory
      with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied
      heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s
      personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the
      economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering
      benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among
      the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going
      into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition
      hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling
      party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu
      views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be
      forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more
      aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.

    default: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared
      victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of
      winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters
      delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on
      power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is
      going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the
      people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New
      Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set
      to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth
      consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful
      politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata
      Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright
      majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on
      coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had
      largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the
      result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected
      leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade
      in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and
      Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics
      accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s
      Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his
      transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a
      developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth
      remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same
      workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment
      spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.
