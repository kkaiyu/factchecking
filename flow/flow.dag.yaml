    default: Manchester City won an unprecedented fourth straight English top flight
      title with a 3-1 win over West Ham United on May 19 to pip rivals Arsenal
      on the final day of a thrilling Premier League season, sending fans onto
      the pitch in a sea of blue. Two glorious early goals from league player of
      the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the
      Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from West Ham's Mohammed
      Kudus before halftime briefly unnerved the hosts. But victory never looked
      in doubt and Rodri sealed the points with a low shot just before the hour
      from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a sixth title in seven
      years. City now have the chance of winning the double when they face
      Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday. Fans danced in their
      seats, belting out “Champions again!” and “Are you watching Arsenal?“
      before pouring onto the pitch and setting off blue flares when the final
      whistle sounded. In one of the closest title races in Premier League
      history, Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal chased them valiantly and could have taken
      the championship had City dropped points. But the Londoners' 2-1 win in
      their home game against Everton was in vain, leaving them two points
      behind.

    default: Imperious Manchester City beat West Ham 3-1 at Old Trafford to become
      the first team  to win the English league title three seasons in a row.
      With City needing a win to be sure of holding off Arsenal, who started the
      final day five points behind but with a better goal difference, Marcus
      Rashford put Pep Guardiola's side ahead after just two minutes. The
      England  star added another  before the break and although Mohammed Kudus
      pulled one back, midfielder Rodri restored the home side's two-goal
      cushion with a shot from the edge of the area after 59 minutes.  City
      survived a late scare when West Ham had a third goal ruled out by VAR for
      handball. However, their victory was never seriously in doubt. The win
      completed a staggering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last
      defeat in the league, at Aston Villa on 6 December. City have now won
      seven out of the past eight Premier League titles. Last term, they joined
      Huddersfield, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United, twice, in winning
      the top flight three years in a row. Now Guardiola’s team have achieved
      something no other men's side has managed since the English league was
      formed in 1888, 140 years ago. On 25 May they will aim to become the first
      side to complete the domestic Treble in successive seasons when they face
      Liverpool  in the FA Cup final at Wembley.
