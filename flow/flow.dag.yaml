    default: The Police have arrested three men, aged between 52 and 62, for their
      suspected involvement in a case of conspiracy to commit cheating involving
      the use of fake gold ingots. On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police
      received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men
      handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations
      revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two
      men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating
      the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to
      send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process
      hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash
      as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings,
      resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim
      then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to
      verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was
      verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men
      took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold
      ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim
      went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold
      ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of
      scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the
      Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam
      and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division
      established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal
      Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also
      arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which
      included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper
      with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three
      men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit
      cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.

    default: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in
      conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52
      and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they
      received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men
      handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary
      investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was
      approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots
      while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The
      men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China
      but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold
      ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as
      collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings”
      that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the
      police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen
      Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out
      to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the
      victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to
      the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was
      told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop.
      Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through
      ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera
      footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men
      and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested
      an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini
      gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six
      gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men
      are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating.
      The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.
