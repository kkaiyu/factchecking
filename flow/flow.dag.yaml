    default: A legal body in Kenya has called for the arrest of a man accused of
      practising law without proper qualifications. Despite not having any
      formal legal training, the “lawyer” won 26 cases in various Kenyan courts
      under the name “Brian N. Mwenda”. The man was a masquerader who had stolen
      the identity of a real lawyer named Brian Mwenda Ntwiga. The revelation,
      which has drawn reactions of outrage and amusement in equal parts in
      Kenya, came to light after the Nairobi Branch of LSK cautioned the public
      about Mr Njagi in a post on social media platform X. The imposter
      criminally access the LSK portal, identify an account with a name
      corresponding to his, tamper with details such as the e-mail address
      connected with it, and upload his own photo. LSK said it was tipped off to
      the breach in September, when Mr Ntwiga contacted them after he was unable
      to access his account on the portal due to the e-mail change, and noted
      changes in other unspecified details as well. On Aug 5, Brian Mwenda
      Ntwiga was admitted to the Bar and his correct e-mail address was
      captured, and an account opened for him in the advocates portal. LSK
      reached out to advocate Brian Mwenda Ntwiga who confirmed that he had not
      applied for a practicing certificate since his admission, reason being
      that he had been working at the Office of the Attorney General and did not
      require a practising certificate. Despite LSK’s warning of Mr Njagi’s
      deception, the incident has won him supporters. Mr Njagi was described as
      a young and brilliant Kenyan who has recently faced condemnation for
      practising law without the traditional law qualifications. This case is
      not unique – there has been an increase in cases of unqualified persons
      pretending to be Advocates of the High Court of Kenya.

    default: A man accused of practising law without qualifications has said he is
      innocent - and thanked people who have come out in support of him. On
      Thursday, legal officials in Kenya urged police to arrest a man practicing
      under the name "Brian Mwenda". They said the man was a masquerader who had
      stolen the identity of a real lawyer, named Brian Mwenda Kevin Ntwiga.
      Local media reported that a "fake lawyer" had won dozens of lawsuits
      despite not being trained. The case has captivated the East African
      country over the past few days, eliciting reactions from outrage to
      amusement. Despite condemnation by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and the
      country's Director of Public Prosecutions, the alleged imposter has
      garnered several supporters He has been praised for being a brilliant
      young mind who has succeeded without traditional qualifications. He
      allegedly accessed the law society’s portal and tampered with the real
      lawyer’s details before uploading an image of himself and claiming to be
      trained in law. The real Brian Mwenda Ntwiga eventually contacted the law
      society after he successfully logged into his online account and realised
      his details had been changed. On the 5th Day of August 2022, Brian Mwenda
      Ntwiga was admitted to the Bar and his correct email address was captured
      and an Account opened for him in the Advocates portal. Advocate Brian
      Mwenda Ntwiga confirmed that he had not applied for a practicing
      certificate since his admission, reason being that he had been working at
      the Office of the DIrector of Public Prosecutions and did not require a
      Practicing Certificate. It was only until sometimes in September 2023 when
      he attempted to login to the system and activate his profile with the
      intention of applying for his Practising Certificate that he realized his
      details were changed in his LSK Portal. That’s when the discovery was
      made. This case is unique – this is the first time an unqualified person
      pretended to be Advocates of the High Court of Kenya.
