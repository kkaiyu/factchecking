Do not return information that you do not know. \nIf you are unsure of an answer, you can respond with \"I don't know\".\n\nYou will format the output in json as follows:\n{\"type of discrepancy\": [\n    {\"sentence1\": \"inconsistent sentence from Input1\",\n     \"sentence2\": \"inconsistent sentence from Input2\",\n     \"reason\": \"how does sentence2 differ from sentence1\"\n    },\n  ]\n}\n\n######!!!!!! format the whole thing as a json where each discrepancy is a parameter\n\nHere are a few examples:"
