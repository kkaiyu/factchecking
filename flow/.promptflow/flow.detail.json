Two glorious early goals from league player of the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from West Ham's Mohammed Kudus before halftime briefly unnerved the hosts. But victory never looked in doubt and Rodri sealed the points with a low shot just before the hour from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a sixth title in seven years. City now have the chance of winning the double when they face Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday. Fans danced in their seats, belting out “Champions again!” and “Are you watching Arsenal?“ before pouring onto the pitch and setting off blue flares when the final whistle sounded. In one of the closest title races in Premier League history, Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal chased them valiantly and could have taken the championship had City dropped points. But the Londoners' 2-1 win in their home game against Everton was in vain, leaving them two points behind. \"\n\nInput2: Imperious Manchester City beat West Ham 3-1 at Old Trafford to become the first team  to win the English league title three seasons in a row. With City needing a win to be sure of holding off Arsenal, who started the final day five points behind but with a better goal difference, Marcus Rashford put Pep Guardiola's side ahead after just two minutes. The England  star added another  before the break and although Mohammed Kudus pulled one back, midfielder Rodri restored the home side's two-goal cushion with a shot from the edge of the area after 59 minutes.  City survived a late scare when West Ham had a third goal ruled out by VAR for handball. However, their victory was never seriously in doubt. The win completed a staggering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last defeat in the league, at Aston Villa on 6 December. City have now won seven out of the past eight Premier League titles. Last term, they joined Huddersfield, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United, twice, in winning the top flight three years in a row. Now Guardiola’s team have achieved something no other men's side has managed since the English league was formed in 1888, 140 years ago.

Two glorious early goals from league player of the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from West Ham's Mohammed Kudus before halftime briefly unnerved the hosts. But victory never looked in doubt and Rodri sealed the points with a low shot just before the hour from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a sixth title in seven years. City now have the chance of winning the double when they face Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday. Fans danced in their seats, belting out “Champions again!” and “Are you watching Arsenal?“ before pouring onto the pitch and setting off blue flares when the final whistle sounded.

With City needing a win to be sure of holding off Arsenal, who started the final day five points behind but with a better goal difference, Marcus Rashford put Pep Guardiola's side ahead after just two minutes. The England  star added another  before the break and although Mohammed Kudus pulled one back, midfielder Rodri restored the home side's two-goal cushion with a shot from the edge of the area after 59 minutes.  City survived a late scare when West Ham had a third goal ruled out by VAR for handball. However, their victory was never seriously in doubt. The win completed a staggering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last defeat in the league, at Aston Villa on 6 December. City have now won seven out of the past eight Premier League titles. Last term, they joined Huddersfield, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United, twice, in winning the top flight three years in a row. Now Guardiola’s team have achieved something no other men's side has managed since the English league was formed in 1888, 140 years ago.
