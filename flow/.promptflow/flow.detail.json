Eleven days after the failed attempt on March 7, Chinese national Wu Zhihong, 55, had to face the music as he pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal trespass. Appearing in court on March 16 via video-link from remand and speaking via a Mandarin interpreter, Wu said: “I never knew that there would be such serious consequences for this.” The court heard that between February and March 2024, Mr Yan Shuqing, 20, searched Chinese e-commerce platforms for resale Singapore Eras Tour tickets. He bought a ticket online for 5000 yuan from a seller on March 6. The seller told him to arrive at the National Stadium ahead of the concert on March 6 – Swift’s fourth show – for his “staff” to help him go through the gates. On the day of the concert, Mr Yan met Wu at the Singapore Sports Hub, where Wu gave him a lanyard and an A4-sized Taylor Swift poster. The two men entered the security check area, where concertgoers’ personal belongings were being checked. Wu was charged with criminal trespass for entering this area as he had intended to dupe security officers into believing that Mr Yan had a valid concert ticket when he did not. After their belongings were checked, Wu gave Mr Yan another concert lanyard with “VIP” imprinted on it. It was genuine and meant for VIP Eras Tour ticket holders. Court documents did not mention how Wu had obtained it. Wu also gave Mr Yan a friendship bracelet, an accessory that was commonly worn and traded by fans at the concerts. To enter the National Stadium, concertgoers had to scan their tickets at a turnstile gate. But Wu told Mr Yan he did not need to do so, and could just “tailgate” any concertgoer who was passing through. Wu told Mr Yan that if he was stopped by security officers, he could still enter by presenting the lanyard and friendship bracelet, and telling the officers that he had friends inside the stadium. CCTV footage played in court shows Wu, who wore a white Eras Tour T-shirt and a black cap, guiding Mr Yan to the queue at the turnstile gate. As the woman in front of Mr Yan scanned her ticket and entered, Wu shoved Mr Yan so that he could also pass through the turnstile gate. At the same time, Wu showed the security officer his phone as if he was trying to communicate with him in a bid to distract the officer from noticing Mr Yan. But another officer noticed the act and stopped Mr Yan, who was escorted out of the National Stadium. After the failed attempt, Wu transferred 3,000 yuan to Mr Yan and told him not to reveal their transaction to the police. Wu then went to another gate and “tailgated” another concertgoer into the National Stadium. An informant subsequently called the police and officers arrested Wu at the scene. Deputy Public Prosecutor Darren Ang said no prosecutorial action was taken against Mr Yan. During investigations, Wu admitted that he is not a Taylor Swift fan. He was unable to explain why he was found with seven other friendship bracelets, similar to the one he had passed to Mr Yan. DPP Ang called for Wu to be jailed for between two and four weeks, noting there is evidence that Wu was involved in an arrangement to target Singapore for criminal activities. Wu had entered Singapore on March 5, 2024, on a social visit pass. He had never entered the country before that.",

He then helped distract a security officer while Yan followed a concertgoer passing through a turnstile gate in front of him at the National Stadium on March 7, 2024. Yan, however, was caught and promptly escorted out. Wu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to one count of intending to cheat security officers into believing that Yan had a valid concert ticket, so that the officers would allow Yan entry. Concertgoers were required to undergo two security checks at the Singapore Sports Hub before entering the National Stadium. These were a Person Check Security and a turnstile gate where they would have to scan their tickets.

Yan was told to arrive at the National Stadium before that start of the concert on Mar 7, 2024 and that someone would help him through the gates. Yan transferred the money.

The game was an instant hit with Apple device users, racking up 40 million downloads in its first four days to become the fastest-selling iOS game in the history of the App Store.\nOUTPUT:\n| Type of Discrepancy | Input1 | Input2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Event Description | Super Mario Run will be taken out of the Google play and apple app store | Super Mario Run is available for play on Android devices |\n| Time | The game is being removed on Friday | The game is available for download now |\n| Actions | Nintendo is planning to release a free version of the game at a later time | Nintendo has made the game available for download earlier than expected |\n| Object | Super Mario Run is not popular and is being removed from the app stores | Super Mario Run is wildly popular and available on the Google Play store |\n\nInput1: A man who attempted to get another man to “tailgate” a concertgoer into Taylor Swift’s concert has been jailed for two weeks in what is believed to be the Republic’s first concluded prosecution linked to the American pop star’s Eras Tour. Eleven days after the failed attempt on March 7, Chinese national Wu Zhihong, 55, had to face the music as he pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal trespass. Appearing in court on March 16 via video-link from remand and speaking via a Mandarin interpreter, Wu said: “I never knew that there would be such serious consequences for this.” The court heard that between February and March 2024, Mr Yan Shuqing, 20, searched Chinese e-commerce platforms for resale Singapore Eras Tour tickets. He bought a ticket online for 5000 yuan from a seller on March 6. The seller told him to arrive at the National Stadium ahead of the concert on March 6 – Swift’s fourth show – for his “staff” to help him go through the gates. On the day of the concert, Mr Yan met Wu at the Singapore Sports Hub, where Wu gave him a lanyard and an A4-sized Taylor Swift poster. The two men entered the security check area, where concertgoers’ personal belongings were being checked. Wu was charged with criminal trespass for entering this area as he had intended to dupe security officers into believing that Mr Yan had a valid concert ticket when he did not. After their belongings were checked, Wu gave Mr Yan another concert lanyard with “VIP” imprinted on it. It was genuine and meant for VIP Eras Tour ticket holders. Court documents did not mention how Wu had obtained it. Wu also gave Mr Yan a friendship bracelet, an accessory that was commonly worn and traded by fans at the concerts. To enter the National Stadium, concertgoers had to scan their tickets at a turnstile gate. But Wu told Mr Yan he did not need to do so, and could just “tailgate” any concertgoer who was passing through. Wu told Mr Yan that if he was stopped by security officers, he could still enter by presenting the lanyard and friendship bracelet, and telling the officers that he had friends inside the stadium. CCTV footage played in court shows Wu, who wore a white Eras Tour T-shirt and a black cap, guiding Mr Yan to the queue at the turnstile gate. As the woman in front of Mr Yan scanned her ticket and entered, Wu shoved Mr Yan so that he could also pass through the turnstile gate. At the same time, Wu showed the security officer his phone as if he was trying to communicate with him in a bid to distract the officer from noticing Mr Yan. But another officer noticed the act and stopped Mr Yan, who was escorted out of the National Stadium. After the failed attempt, Wu transferred 3,000 yuan to Mr Yan and told him not to reveal their transaction to the police. Wu then went to another gate and “tailgated” another concertgoer into the National Stadium. An informant subsequently called the police and officers arrested Wu at the scene. Deputy Public Prosecutor Darren Ang said no prosecutorial action was taken against Mr Yan. During investigations, Wu admitted that he is not a Taylor Swift fan. He was unable to explain why he was found with seven other friendship bracelets, similar to the one he had passed to Mr Yan. DPP Ang called for Wu to be jailed for between two and four weeks, noting there is evidence that Wu was involved in an arrangement to target Singapore for criminal activities. Wu had entered Singapore on March 5, 2024, on a social visit pass. He had never entered the country before that.\nInput2: A man who helped another man illegally enter Taylor Swift's concert in Singapore was jailed for two weeks on Monday (Mar 18). Wu Zhihong, 54, tried to cheat security officers into believing that 20-year-old Yan Shuqing had a valid Singapore Eras Tour concert ticket. He then helped distract a security officer while Yan followed a concertgoer passing through a turnstile gate in front of him at the National Stadium on March 7, 2024. Yan, however, was caught and promptly escorted out. Wu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to one count of intending to cheat security officers into believing that Yan had a valid concert ticket, so that the officers would allow Yan entry. Concertgoers were required to undergo two security checks at the Singapore Sports Hub before entering the National Stadium. These were a Person Check Security and a turnstile gate where they would have to scan their tickets. The court heard that Yan searched for re-sold Singapore Eras Tour tickets and came across an offer to purchase a ticket for 3,000 yuan (S$557). Yan was told to arrive at the National Stadium before that start of the concert on Mar 7, 2024 and that someone would help him through the gates. Yan transferred the money. As part of the arrangement, he met Wu at about 3.50pm on Mar 7 around the Singapore Sports Hub. There, Wu handed Yan a lanyard and a Taylor Swift poster.\nOUTPUT:\n| Type of Discrepancy | Input1 | Input2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Person | Wu Zhihong is 55 years old | Wu Zhihong is 54 years old |\n| Object | Mr Yan bought a ticket online for 5000 yuan | Yan came across an offer to purchase a ticket for 3,000 yuan |\n| Time | Wu Zhihong appeared in court on March 16 | Wu Zhihong was jailed on Monday (Mar 18) |\n| Actions | Wu Zhihong gave Mr Yan a lanyard and an A4-sized Taylor Swift poster at the Singapore Sports Hub | Wu handed Yan a lanyard and a Taylor Swift poster at about 3.50pm on Mar 7 around the Singapore Sports Hub |\n\nInput1: Setting Up Face-Off With Trump 'California's clean-air agency voted on Friday to reevaluate their stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Eleven days after the failed attempt on March 7, Chinese national Wu Zhihong, 55, had to face the music as he pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal trespass. Appearing in court on March 16 via video-link from remand and speaking via a Mandarin interpreter, Wu said: “I never knew that there would be such serious consequences for this.” The court heard that between February and March 2024, Mr Yan Shuqing, 20, searched Chinese e-commerce platforms for resale Singapore Eras Tour tickets. He bought a ticket online for 5000 yuan from a seller on March 6. The seller told him to arrive at the National Stadium ahead of the concert on March 6 – Swift’s fourth show – for his “staff” to help him go through the gates. On the day of the concert, Mr Yan met Wu at the Singapore Sports Hub, where Wu gave him a lanyard and an A4-sized Taylor Swift poster. The two men entered the security check area, where concertgoers’ personal belongings were being checked. Wu was charged with criminal trespass for entering this area as he had intended to dupe security officers into believing that Mr Yan had a valid concert ticket when he did not. After their belongings were checked, Wu gave Mr Yan another concert lanyard with “VIP” imprinted on it. It was genuine and meant for VIP Eras Tour ticket holders. Court documents did not mention how Wu had obtained it. Wu also gave Mr Yan a friendship bracelet, an accessory that was commonly worn and traded by fans at the concerts. To enter the National Stadium, concertgoers had to scan their tickets at a turnstile gate. But Wu told Mr Yan he did not need to do so, and could just “tailgate” any concertgoer who was passing through. Wu told Mr Yan that if he was stopped by security officers, he could still enter by presenting the lanyard and friendship bracelet, and telling the officers that he had friends inside the stadium. CCTV footage played in court shows Wu, who wore a white Eras Tour T-shirt and a black cap, guiding Mr Yan to the queue at the turnstile gate. As the woman in front of Mr Yan scanned her ticket and entered, Wu shoved Mr Yan so that he could also pass through the turnstile gate. At the same time, Wu showed the security officer his phone as if he was trying to communicate with him in a bid to distract the officer from noticing Mr Yan. But another officer noticed the act and stopped Mr Yan, who was escorted out of the National Stadium. After the failed attempt, Wu transferred 3,000 yuan to Mr Yan and told him not to reveal their transaction to the police. Wu then went to another gate and “tailgated” another concertgoer into the National Stadium. An informant subsequently called the police and officers arrested Wu at the scene. Deputy Public Prosecutor Darren Ang said no prosecutorial action was taken against Mr Yan. During investigations, Wu admitted that he is not a Taylor Swift fan. He was unable to explain why he was found with seven other friendship bracelets, similar to the one he had passed to Mr Yan. DPP Ang called for Wu to be jailed for between two and four weeks, noting there is evidence that Wu was involved in an arrangement to target Singapore for criminal activities. Wu had entered Singapore on March 5, 2024, on a social visit pass. He had never entered the country before that.",

Wu Zhihong, 54, tried to cheat security officers into believing that 20-year-old Yan Shuqing had a valid Singapore Eras Tour concert ticket. He then helped distract a security officer while Yan followed a concertgoer passing through a turnstile gate in front of him at the National Stadium on March 7, 2024. Yan, however, was caught and promptly escorted out. Wu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to one count of intending to cheat security officers into believing that Yan had a valid concert ticket, so that the officers would allow Yan entry. Concertgoers were required to undergo two security checks at the Singapore Sports Hub before entering the National Stadium. These were a Person Check Security and a turnstile gate where they would have to scan their tickets. The court heard that Yan searched for re-sold Singapore Eras Tour tickets and came across an offer to purchase a ticket for 3,000 yuan (S$557). Yan was told to arrive at the National Stadium before that start of the concert on Mar 7, 2024 and that someone would help him through the gates. Yan transferred the money. As part of the arrangement, he met Wu at about 3.50pm on Mar 7 around the Singapore Sports Hub. There, Wu handed Yan a lanyard and a Taylor Swift poster.",

After the failed attempt, Wu transferred 3,000 yuan to Mr Yan and told him not to reveal their transaction to the police. Wu then went to another gate and “tailgated” another concertgoer into the National Stadium. An informant subsequently called the police and officers arrested Wu at the scene. Deputy Public Prosecutor Darren Ang said no prosecutorial action was taken against Mr Yan. During investigations, Wu admitted that he is not a Taylor Swift fan. He was unable to explain why he was found with seven other friendship bracelets, similar to the one he had passed to Mr Yan. DPP Ang called for Wu to be jailed for between two and four weeks, noting there is evidence that Wu was involved in an arrangement to target Singapore for criminal activities.

Eleven days after the failed attempt on March 7, Chinese national Wu Zhihong, 55, had to face the music as he pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal trespass. Appearing in court on March 16 via video-link from remand and speaking via a Mandarin interpreter, Wu said: “I never knew that there would be such serious consequences for this.” The court heard that between February and March 2024, Mr Yan Shuqing, 20, searched Chinese e-commerce platforms for resale Singapore Eras Tour tickets. He bought a ticket online for 5000 yuan from a seller on March 6. The seller told him to arrive at the National Stadium ahead of the concert on March 6 – Swift’s fourth show – for his “staff” to help him go through the gates. On the day of the concert, Mr Yan met Wu at the Singapore Sports Hub, where Wu gave him a lanyard and an A4-sized Taylor Swift poster. The two men entered the security check area, where concertgoers’ personal belongings were being checked. Wu was charged with criminal trespass for entering this area as he had intended to dupe security officers into believing that Mr Yan had a valid concert ticket when he did not. After their belongings were checked, Wu gave Mr Yan another concert lanyard with “VIP” imprinted on it. It was genuine and meant for VIP Eras Tour ticket holders. Court documents did not mention how Wu had obtained it. Wu also gave Mr Yan a friendship bracelet, an accessory that was commonly worn and traded by fans at the concerts. To enter the National Stadium, concertgoers had to scan their tickets at a turnstile gate. But Wu told Mr Yan he did not need to do so, and could just “tailgate” any concertgoer who was passing through. Wu told Mr Yan that if he was stopped by security officers, he could still enter by presenting the lanyard and friendship bracelet, and telling the officers that he had friends inside the stadium. CCTV footage played in court shows Wu, who wore a white Eras Tour T-shirt and a black cap, guiding Mr Yan to the queue at the turnstile gate. As the woman in front of Mr Yan scanned her ticket and entered, Wu shoved Mr Yan so that he could also pass through the turnstile gate. At the same time, Wu showed the security officer his phone as if he was trying to communicate with him in a bid to distract the officer from noticing Mr Yan. But another officer noticed the act and stopped Mr Yan, who was escorted out of the National Stadium.

Eleven days after the failed attempt on March 7, Chinese national Wu Zhihong, 55, had to face the music as he pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal trespass. Appearing in court on March 16 via video-link from remand and speaking via a Mandarin interpreter, Wu said: “I never knew that there would be such serious consequences for this.” The court heard that between February and March 2024, Mr Yan Shuqing, 20, searched Chinese e-commerce platforms for resale Singapore Eras Tour tickets. He bought a ticket online for 5000 yuan from a seller on March 6. The seller told him to arrive at the National Stadium ahead of the concert on March 6 – Swift’s fourth show – for his “staff” to help him go through the gates. On the day of the concert, Mr Yan met Wu at the Singapore Sports Hub, where Wu gave him a lanyard and an A4-sized Taylor Swift poster. The two men entered the security check area, where concertgoers’ personal belongings were being checked. Wu was charged with criminal trespass for entering this area as he had intended to dupe security officers into believing that Mr Yan had a valid concert ticket when he did not. After their belongings were checked, Wu gave Mr Yan another concert lanyard with “VIP” imprinted on it. It was genuine and meant for VIP Eras Tour ticket holders. Court documents did not mention how Wu had obtained it. Wu also gave Mr Yan a friendship bracelet, an accessory that was commonly worn and traded by fans at the concerts. To enter the National Stadium, concertgoers had to scan their tickets at a turnstile gate. But Wu told Mr Yan he did not need to do so, and could just “tailgate” any concertgoer who was passing through. Wu told Mr Yan that if he was stopped by security officers, he could still enter by presenting the lanyard and friendship bracelet, and telling the officers that he had friends inside the stadium. CCTV footage played in court shows Wu, who wore a white Eras Tour T-shirt and a black cap, guiding Mr Yan to the queue at the turnstile gate. As the woman in front of Mr Yan scanned her ticket and entered, Wu shoved Mr Yan so that he could also pass through the turnstile gate. At the same time, Wu showed the security officer his phone as if he was trying to communicate with him in a bid to distract the officer from noticing Mr Yan. But another officer noticed the act and stopped Mr Yan, who was escorted out of the National Stadium. After the failed attempt, Wu transferred 3,000 yuan to Mr Yan and told him not to reveal their transaction to the police. Wu then went to another gate and “tailgated” another concertgoer into the National Stadium. An informant subsequently called the police and officers arrested Wu at the scene. Deputy Public Prosecutor Darren Ang said no prosecutorial action was taken against Mr Yan. During investigations, Wu admitted that he is not a Taylor Swift fan. He was unable to explain why he was found with seven other friendship bracelets, similar to the one he had passed to Mr Yan. DPP Ang called for Wu to be jailed for between two and four weeks, noting there is evidence that Wu was involved in an arrangement to target Singapore for criminal activities. Wu had entered Singapore on March 5, 2024, on a social visit pass. He had never entered the country before that.",
