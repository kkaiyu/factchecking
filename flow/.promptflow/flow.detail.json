        "input1": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.",
        "input2": "India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally."

Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party.

But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams.

A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}",

                "Input": "Input1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}",

A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}",

Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all.

India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}",

Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}\nOutput:"

But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}], \"Person\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The role of Narendra Modi in Sentence2 (President) does not match with the role in Sentence1 (Prime Minister).\"}, {\"Sentence1\": \"Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago.\", \"Sentence2\": \"Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.\", \"Reason\": \"The term of office for Narendra Modi in Sentence2 (fourth term) does not match with the term in Sentence1 (third term).\"}]}"

        "factual": "Input1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.

Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.",

But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.",

            "Input1": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda.

But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce.

      "result": "Input1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}",

        "Input": "Input1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}",

Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues.

      "result": "Input1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}]}",

          "output": "Input1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}], \"Person\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The role of Narendra Modi in Sentence2 (President) does not match with the role in Sentence1 (Prime Minister).\"}, {\"Sentence1\": \"Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago.\", \"Sentence2\": \"Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.\", \"Reason\": \"The term of office for Narendra Modi in Sentence2 (fourth term) does not match with the term in Sentence1 (third term).\"}]}",

      "result": "Input1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening. Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago. That leaves Modi and the BJP politically diminished after losing ground to a revived opposition bloc that successfully wrested territory with a campaign focused on economic issues. The BJP’s campaign relied heavily on the fulfilment of Hindu-nationalist pledges and on Modi’s personal brand. It failed to enough traction among voters worried that the economy - while among the world’s fastest-growing - isn’t delivering benefits evenly to all. Issues such as high unemployment, especially among the youth, and the rising cost of living, weighed heavily on voters going into the election, according to polls. A newly energised opposition hammered on these bread-and-butter issues to the detriment of the ruling party. Many of the BJP’s alliance partners don’t share the fiery pro-Hindu views that are core to the BJP agenda. That means that the BJP could be forced to dial back harsh rhetoric and set aside ambitions to more aggressively reshape India into an overtly Hindu nation.\n\nInput2: India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning, but his goal of winning an unassailable majority was left in tatters after voters delivered a shock result that reduced the extent of his party’s grip on power. “Today is a glorious day… National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the fourth time, we are grateful to the people,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi. “This is a victory for the world’s largest democracy.” Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party fell short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. India’s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi’s divisive style. A democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity, but his decade in power has not been aithout controversy.Religious persecution and Islamophobia have also increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party’s Hindu-nationalist dreams. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047. He inherited a rising economy and India’s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with graduate unemployment spiraling and much of the country’s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The day of the election result in Sentence2 (Wednesday morning) does not match with the day in Sentence1 (Tuesday evening).\"}], \"Person\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dealt a major setback in India's general election, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to secure an outright parliamentary majority on Tuesday evening.\", \"Sentence2\": \"India's transformative yet divisive President Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Wednesday morning,\", \"Reason\": \"The role of Narendra Modi in Sentence2 (President) does not match with the role in Sentence1 (Prime Minister).\"}, {\"Sentence1\": \"Modi has said he will remain in office for a third term, but the BJP will be forced into a coalition government for the first time since it came to power a decade ago.\", \"Sentence2\": \"Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies – a fourth consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.\", \"Reason\": \"The term of office for Narendra Modi in Sentence2 (fourth term) does not match with the term in Sentence1 (third term).\"}]}",
