        "input1": "The Police have arrested three men, aged between 52 and 62, for their suspected involvement in a case of conspiracy to commit cheating involving the use of fake gold ingots. On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.",
        "input2": "Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine."

On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.",

On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.\nOutput:"

Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.",

Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues.

                          "content": "Input1: The Police have arrested three men, aged between 52 and 62, for their suspected involvement in a case of conspiracy to commit cheating involving the use of fake gold ingots. On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. \n\n{}",

Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots.

On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. \n\n{}\nOutput:"

            "input1": "The Police have arrested three men, aged between 52 and 62, for their suspected involvement in a case of conspiracy to commit cheating involving the use of fake gold ingots. On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.",
            "input2": "Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine."

        "Input1": "The Police have arrested three men, aged between 52 and 62, for their suspected involvement in a case of conspiracy to commit cheating involving the use of fake gold ingots. On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake.

Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.",

Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues.

The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000.

Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.",

On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024.

        "Input": "Input1: The Police have arrested three men, aged between 52 and 62, for their suspected involvement in a case of conspiracy to commit cheating involving the use of fake gold ingots. On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. \n\n{}",

On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other “gold ingots” and was told that those were fake. By then, the two men had left the shop. Realising that she had fallen for a scam, she alerted the police. Through ground inquiries, images from PolCam and closed-circuit television camera footage, officers from the Central Police Division identified the two men and arrested them in Aliwal Street on June 20. The officers also arrested an accomplice after further investigations. More than 80 mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues were among items seized. The three men are expected to be charged on June 22 with conspiracy to commit cheating. The offence carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. \n\n{}",

On 19 June 2024 at about 3.15pm, the Police received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4000 after two men handed over to her gold ingots for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations revealed on 19 June 2024 at about 1pm, the victim was approached by two men along Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while excavating the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men claimed they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process hence offered for victim to safekeep the gold ingots but to hand them cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings, resembling an old will, as well as a small piece of gold ingot. The victim then brought the two men to goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small piece of gold ingot, and it was verified to be genuine. After the gold had been authenticated, the two men took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over other purported gold ingots to the victim and told her to pay $4000 as a collateral. The victim went to the same goldsmith shop to further authenticate the other gold ingots and they were found to be fake. Upon realising she was a victim of scam and discovered the two men had left the place, she alerted the Police. Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from PolCam and CCTV camera footages, officers from Central Police Division established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on 20 June 2024. Through further investigations, the officers also arrested another accomplice and seized a number of case exhibits which included over 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini-Buddha statues. The three men will be charged in court on 22 June 2024 with conspiracy to commit cheating, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine.\n\nInput2: Three men were arrested on June 20 over their alleged involvement in conspiring to cheat using fake gold ingots. The men are aged between 52 and 62, the police said in a statement on June 21. The police said they received a report that a female victim was cheated of $4,000 after two men handed over “gold ingots” to her for safekeeping. Preliminary investigations showed that on June 19 at about 1pm, the woman was approached by two men in Tras Street claiming to have found gold ingots while they were digging the ground at an unknown site in Singapore. The men then claimed that they wanted to send the gold pieces back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They offered to leave the gold ingots with the victim for safekeeping if she agreed to give them cash as collateral. The men also showed her a document with “old Chinese writings” that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, said the police. The victim took the two men to a goldsmith shop in Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. It turned out to be genuine. The men then took back the genuine gold ingot, gave the victim other “gold ingots” and told her to pay $4,000.
