Do not return information that you do not know. \nIf you are unsure of an answer, you can respond with \"I don't know\".\n\nYou will format the output as follows:\nInput1, Input2 and a list of discrepancies found by this LLM. \nList of discrepancies found by this LLM should only include discrepancies related to DATE and/or TIME.\nIf there are no discrepancies related to DATE and/or TIME found, output the input as it is. \nDo not add additional or edit any information within the input.\n\nThe list of discrepancies can be outputted as a json as follows: \n{\"DateTime\": [\n    {\"Sentence1\": \"inconsistent sentence from Input1\",\n     \"Sentence2\": \"inconsistent sentence from Input2\",\n     \"Reason\": \"how does Sentence2 differ from Sentence1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe reason given should be concise.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nInput1: Some opposition parties congratulated Mr Lawrence Wong ahead of his swearing-in as prime minister at the Istana on May 15, while thanking outgoing prime minister Lee Hsien Loong for his decades of public service and leadership.\nInput2: Some opposition parties congratulated Mr Lawrence Wong ahead of his swearing-in as prime minister at the Istana on May 15, while thanking outgoing prime minister Lee Hsien Loong for his decades of public service and leadership.\nOutput: Input1: Some opposition parties congratulated Mr Lawrence Wong ahead of his swearing-in as prime minister at the Istana on May 15, while thanking outgoing prime minister Lee Hsien Loong for his decades of public service and leadership.\n\nInput2: Some opposition parties congratulated Mr Lawrence Wong ahead of his swearing-in as prime minister at the Istana on May 15, while thanking outgoing prime minister Lee Hsien Loong for his decades of public service and leadership.\nInput1: Singapore “strongly condemns” the attack that took place at a police station in Johor on May 17, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement.\nInput2: Singapore “strongly condemns” the attack that took place at a police station in Johor on April 7, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement.\nOutput: Input1: Singapore “strongly condemns” the attack that took place at a police station in Johor on May 17, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement.\n\nInput2: Singapore “strongly condemns” the attack that took place at a police station in Johor on April 7, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement.\n\n{\"DateTime\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Singapore \\u201cstrongly condemns\\u201d the attack that took place at a\\u00a0police station in Johor on May 17, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement.\", \"Sentence2\": \"Singapore \\u201cstrongly condemns\\u201d the attack that took place at a\\u00a0police station in Johor on April 7, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement.\", \"Reason\": \"The date of the attack in Sentence2 (April 7) does not match the date in Sentence1 (May 17).\"}]}\nInput1: More than 160 automated lanes were installed in 2023, with another 230 lanes to be set up in 2024.

Consider the context in which these objects are present.\nIf an object in Input2 does not match that of Input1 given the same context, flag the information out as a discrepancy.\n\nConsider the semantic meaning of the information within the inputs.\nParaphrased points with similar semantic meaning do not constitute a discrepancy.\n\nWork in a step by step way to ensure that your response is correct. \nAlways ensure that your responses are based on the provided facts from Input1 and Input2. Avoid fabricating information.\nDo not return information not in the inputs. Do not return information that you do not know. \nIf you are unsure of an answer, you can respond with \"I don't know\".\n\nYou will format the output as follows:\nInput1, Input2 and append any discrepancies related to OBJECTS found by this LLM to the json present in the input.\nIf there are no discrepancies related to OBJECTS found, output the input as it is. \nIf there are discrepancies, the output should only contain DATE and/or TIME, LOCATION and OBJECT discrepancies.\nDo not add additional or edit any information within the input.\n\nThe list of discrepancies can be added as a json as follows: \n{\"Object\": [\n    {\"Sentence1\": \"inconsistent sentence from Input1\",\n     \"Sentence2\": \"inconsistent sentence from Input2\",\n     \"Reason\": \"how does Sentence2 differ from Sentence1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nHere are a few examples:\nInput: Input1: Li was arrested at the scene and a knife was seized. \n\nInput2: Li was arrested at the scene and a gun was seized. \nOutput: Input1: Li was arrested at the scene and a knife was seized.\n\nInput2: Li was arrested at the scene and a gun was seized.\n\n{\"Object\": [{\"Sentence1\": \"Li was arrested at the scene and a knife was seized.\", \"Sentence2\": \"Li was arrested at the scene and a gun was seized.\", \"Reason\": \"The object seized at the scene is a knife in Sentence1, but in Sentence 2 it is a gun.\"}]}"
