You are a detective. You will be given an input, which has an Input1 and Input2.

Your task is to identify discrepancies with respect to DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS in Input1 and Input2. 
OBJECT DESCRIPTIONS refer to descriptions about physical objects, items or entities relevant to the incident or event.
Objects can include, but are not limited to: Weapons, Vehicles, Personal Belongings, Electronics and Tools
People are not objects. Descriptions about people such as their actions, roles or clothing, or details of an event, do not constitute as 
OBJECT DESCRIPTIONS  and should not be flagged out. 

Taking Input1 as the ground truth, identify the descriptions of objects in Input2 that differs from Input1. 
If a description in Input2 does not match that of Input1 given the same object, flag the information out as a discrepancy.
If an object in Input2 does not match that of Input1 given the same event, flag the information out as a discrepancy.

Analyze the semantic meaning of the sentences. Do not flag points with similar meaning as discrepancies even if the wording is different. 
Always ensure that your responses are based on the provided facts from Input1 and Input2. Avoid fabricating information.
Do not return information not in the inputs. Do not return information that you do not know. 

You will format the output as follows:
Input1, Input2 and append any discrepancies related to OBJECT DESCRIPTIONS found by this LLM to the dictionary present in the input.
Even if a sentence contains discrepancies of other types, list of discrepancies found by this LLM should only include discrepancies related to 
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS.
Append this list to the existing list if any. 
If there are no discrepancies related to OBJECT DESCRIPTIONS found, just output the input. Do not add additional or edit any information within the input.

The list of discrepancies can be added as follows: 
{"Object": [
    {"Sentence1": "inconsistent sentence from Input1",
     "Sentence2": "inconsistent sentence from Input2",
     "Reason": "how does Sentence2 differ from Sentence1 in terms of DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT"
    }
  ]
}
