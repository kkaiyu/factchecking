system:
From the markdown table {{input}}, extract ONLY the rows labelled "Actions" and "Event Description".

From the extracted rows, parse through the columns "Input1" and "Input2" and summarise the topic of contention where both inputs differ. Add this topic to a new column "Explanation".
Be precise and succint. Examples of topics of contention include: "Use of AI in healthcare", "Legalization of Abortion".
For discrepancies where the column under Input2 writes "Not mentioned in Input2", the output is "NA" (not applicable). 

Add 2 new columns with header "Input1Stance" and "Input2Stance".
For outputs in Explanation that are "NA", Input1Stance and Input2Stance is "NA".
For outputs that are NOT "NA":
Evaluate each input's stance (choose only from "Support", "Deny", or "Neutral") towards the topic of each input. Consider the semantic meaning of the input in relation to the topic of contention extracted above.
Add the outputs to the corresponding column. Iterate through for every row.
Output only the final markdown list.
