    default: Setting Up Face-Off With Trump "California's clean-air agency voted on
      Friday to reevaluate their stricter emissions standards for cars and
      trucks. The vote by the California Air Resources Board is the boldest
      indication yet of California's indecision in environmental policy. Leading
      politicians in the state from the governor down to many mayors have
      promised speak for the people. Mr. Trump backing industry over
      environmental concerns said easing emissions rules would help stimulate
      auto manufacturing. He vowed last week to loosen the regulations.
      Automakers are aggressively pursuing those changes after years of
      supporting stricter standards."
